## Lesson 7 - Image Representation and Analysis
- computer vision used in AI systems to visually perceive the world by gathering images, analyzing data, and eventually responding to it.

Computer Vision Pipeline
	1. Input Data
		- Images or Images Frame
	2. Pre-Processing
		- Noice Reduction
		- Color Correction
		- Scaling
	3. Selecting Areas of Interest
		- Face Reduction
		- Image Cropping
	4. Feature Extraction
		- Finding Facial Markers (mouth, eyes...etc)
	5. Prediction/Recognition
		- Facial Expression Recognition
		- Emotion Prediction
	6. ACTION!


### Pre-Processing
- all about making an image or sets of images easier to analyze and process computationally.
- 2 purposes:
	1. *Correct* images and eliminate unwanted traits.
	2. *Enhance* the most important parts of an image.

Color to Grayscale
	1. Grayscale is more useful in recognizing objects.
	2. Color images are harder to analyze and wake up more space in memory.
